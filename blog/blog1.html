        <h1>The Parables of Jesus</h1>

        <img src="images/jesus.jpg" alt="Jesus Teaching" class="blog-image">

        <p>Jesus often used parables—short, symbolic stories—to teach profound spiritual truths...</p>

        <h2>Why Did Jesus Use Parables?</h2>
        <blockquote>“The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.” (Matthew 13:11, NIV)</blockquote>
        <p>Jesus used parables to reveal truth to those who were spiritually open while concealing it from those who refused to believe.</p>

            <li>Showing love, grace, and forgiveness.</li>
            <li>Caring for others, as the Good Samaritan did.</li>
            <li>Growing in faith, even if it starts small like a mustard seed.</li>
        </ul>
